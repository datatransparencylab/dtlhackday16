        <p>
        All attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff at our hackathon are
        required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will
        enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all
        participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody.
        </p>
        <div class="question col-xs-24 col-sm-16">
          <h2> Summary </h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
          Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
          for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
          age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
          race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, previous hackathon attendance
          or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned). We do
          not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual
          language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue,
          including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other
          online media. Hackathon participants violating these rules may be
          sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund (if
          applicable) at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.
          </p>
          <h2> The Details </h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).
          </p>
          <p>
            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            As this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.
