     - title: "Raising Awareness of Personal Information Leaks"
       id: "recon-visualization"
       hook: > 
         Northeastern University has been running <a
         href="http://recon.meddle.mobi/"> ReCon project </a>with the 
         target of identifying which mobile apps are leaking Personal Information,
         which type of information it's leaked and what are the destinations of 
         that info. We want you to create different tools that leverage the 
         insights discovered by this project.
       description: >
         <ol>
           <li>
             The first idea for the hack is developing a visualization on top
             of the ReCon Dataest that let people understand what is going on 
             with their data when they use mobile applications on their mobile 
             devices. This could be built directly by using ReCon Dataset.
           </li>
           <li>
             Another idea is developing a browser plugin that let end-users
             check what is the level of leakiness of an application when she is 
             browsing the application homepage in the Google Play or App Stores.
           </li>
           <li>
             An Android application that scans the applications a user has 
             installed in her device and tells her the potential information 
             that those applications could be leaking and calculates a 
             <i>leaking </i> score for her device. The idea would be using 
             ReCon API to develop an Android application that scans the other 
             apps installed in the device and use the API to check if any of
             those apps has been spotted in the past leaking Personal 
             Information by ReCon. The application could offer user advise 
             about how to proceed depending on how bad the issues spotted in 
             the installed applications are.
           </li>
           <li>
             The idea would be implementing a Browser extension that inspects
             the traffic and provides a similar level of detection of Personal
             Infomration leaks to third parties.
           </li>
           <li>
             We would like also to provide users with a Real-time visualization
             of leaks that let them better understand which information is 
             being sent and where is it sent to.
           </li>
           <li>
             We would also love a mecanism in which users could contribute back
             their feedback about the leaks so we could create a crowdsourcing
             database with all the modificatoin/blocking rules users create.
           </li>

       hook: >
         Thanks to a Princeton project named <a
         href="https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/">Privacy
         Census</a>, we can now understand how extended are tracking techniques
         over the web, including advanced ones such as fingerprinting. However, 
         this information might be difficult to process and understand for the 
         average user. We are looking for ways to communicate this appropriately
         to end-users so they can understand what are those techniques, how are 
         they used and how do they affect them.
       description: > 
         <ol>
           <li>
             One idea would be using either the whole dataset shared by 
             Princeton or a simplified dataset that just contains the key 
             insights about some of the key tracking techniques that are being 
             analysed. The visualization could be, for instance, a website that 
             shows which are the top domains using fingerpriting, or how 
             fingerprinting adoption varies depending on the geography or on the 
             website type.
           </li>
           <li>
             Another idea would be building  a browser plugin that, utilising 
             the information already spotted by Princeton, shows user 
             information about the site she is browsing or even show her the 
             level of exposure to fingerprinting according to the browsing 
             history. This could be built via a browser plugin that monitors the 
             current website, compares it to the findings database and informs
             the user (e.g. via an icon) about the usage of Finferprinting.
           </li>
           <li>
             The challenges above mostly target fingerprinting techniques, but 
             the Dataset also contains information about stateful tracking 
             (e.g. cookies, headers...) thata could be used for many other 
             ideas.

       id: "fdvt-material"
       hook: >
         <a href="http://fdvt.org/">Facebook Data Valuation Tool</a> is a
         Browser plugin that has been developed by Carlos III University. The
         plugin shows end-user an estimation of the value they are generating
         to Facebook based on her browsing activity (i.e. the ads she watches
         and clicks on).
       description: >
         In this context, we are thinking in two different directions that
         could be used by the teams.
         On one hand, we would like to offer end-users the possibility to 
         explore what type of ads are shown to them. Thanks to this tool 
         we have a good set of historical data about Facebook sessions and ads.
         The idea would be building visualizations that let users understand
         which companies are targetting them: top advertisers, type of ads, 
         historical evolution, etc. This could be implemented as stand-alone
         visualization but also could be potentially embeded into the plugin 
         itself.
         On the other hand, we are also interested in the creation of companion
         education material that based on the tool, let users understand
         clearly the value they have for facebook, and on which facets do their
         value depend.  Education Material could be some statistics/data, a
         vídeo, a website, etc. For instance, it would be interesting to 
         communicate users how their value vary depending on the audience
         in which they are categorised and how are they assigned to those audiences.

       hook: >
         During the last year, people have started to be aware of the 
         importance of personal data for Internet companies. However,
         it's not clear how much value do they have for those companies.
         We thinks users would love a way to calculate how much they are
         worth, taking into account the type of data, the specific data 
         and the potential number of similar users.
       description: >
         This could be built in different ways: as a website in which the
         user can input manually some data or connect to some of the services
         they use, as a mobile application or as a browser plugin that
         detects user activity.

         Many people unknowingly volunteer sensitive personal information and
         fail to restrict access to it. This kind of information is 
         analytically valuable to both data brokers and exploitation value to 
         attackers. The idea is raising awareness of the potential danger 
         it has for users.
       description: >
         By using public, unauthenticated APIs to collect information on
         individuals that could be used to answer a security question or is
         otherwise sensitive. You may make inferences based solely on metadata
         if appropriate. The goal is to demonstrate accidental disclosure and
         raise awareness.  Example: Someone tweets “I got a new car!” and a 
         photo. You now have the make and model of their current, and maybe 
         first, vehicle. This information may come up in an account recovery 
         process.

         Tracking mechanisms often can't separate child and adult activity,
         putting children at risk for targeted advertising and analytics. 
         Younger generations also tend to have a much larger “digital 
         footprint”, often increasing their risk of identity theft and 
         cyberstalking. There's no technical “silver bullet” for these complex
         issues, so educating parents and children is key to improving their 
         cyber safety.
       description: >
         The goal is creating an interactive tool for educating parents, 
         children, or both on topics related to online privacy. This an 
         open-ended challenge so you may use any format, API, language, or 
         platform you see fit!
